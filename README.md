# Custom Javascript Testing Framework
A Javascript testing framework built from scratch

## Framework functionality so far:

- Allows tests to be grouped / nested

- Displays test descriptions
- Displays which tests passed or failed
- Displays pass in green and fail in red

- Has an equality matcher
- Has a "throws errors" matcher

*Backlog or further requirements:*
- The testing Framework should be extracted to its own Github repository with documentation to be reusable.
- It should have helpful error messages (why has the test failed / error stack)
- It should allow mocking
- It should allow code to be run before each test
- It should have a "respond to" matcher (edited)
